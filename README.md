## About This Project

- **Commonly used weak passwords**


## Technology Used
- **Python**
- **Regex** (for pattern matching)
- **Requests** (to intereact with the Have I Been Pwned API)
- **Hashlib** (for SHA-1 password hashing)

## Features
• Checks password complexity  
• Provides feedback on password strength  
• Prevents use of weak/common passwords
• Checks if the password has been exposed in real-world breaches using the [Have I Been Pwned API]
